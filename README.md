VowelParameterExtractor is a script for extracting f1-f4 acoustic parameters (individual, mean, st.dev. and derivative values), 
raw and Lobanov's normalized duration, the cartesian distances (under development)
and plot vowels in the f2xf1 acoustic space.

%% WARNING %%

For plotting purposes, it is required to have at least to pairs of audio/TextGrid files!

VowelPlot is a script for plotting vowels semi-automatically in the F1/F2 acoustic space.                     ##
It was developed for L2 pronunciation teaching, sociophonetic differences in vowels for different dialects as well as for clinic phonetics.

VowelPlot has a Portuguese version in this repository.

The "AudioPractice.wav" and "AudioPractice.TextGrid" files can serve as an example to run VowelPlot procedures.
